<h4>THE NATURAL
AND ARTIFICIAL DISINTEGRATION
OF THE ELEMENTS</h4>


<h5><i>By</i> Professor Sir ERNEST RUTHERFORD, Kt., D. Sc.,
<br>
LL. D., Ph. D., D. Phys., F. R. S.</h5>

<p>
IT is not my intention in this paper to give a detailed account of the
natural disintegration of the radio elements or of the methods employed
to effect the artificial disintegration of certain light elements. I
shall assume that you all have a general knowledge of the results of
these investigations, but I shall confine myself to a consideration of
the bearing of these results on our knowledge of the structure of the
nuclei of atoms.
</p>
<p>
There is now a general agreement that the atoms of all elements have a
similar electrical structure, consisting of a central positively
charged nucleus surrounded at a distance by the appropriate number of
electrons. From a study of the scattering of <i>α</i> particles by the
atoms of matter and from the classical researches of Moseley on X-ray
spectra, we know that the resultant positive charge on the nucleus of
any atom, in terms of the fundamental unit of electronic charge, is
given numerically by the atomic or ordinal number of the element, due
allowance being made for missing elements. We know that with few
exceptions all nuclear charges, from 1 for the lightest atom, hydrogen,
to 92 for the heaviest element, uranium, are represented by elements
found in the earth. The nuclear charge of an element controls the number
and distribution of the external electrons, so that the properties of an
atom are defined by a whole number, representing its nuclear charge, and
are only to a minor degree influenced by the mass or atomic weight of
the atom.
</p>
<p>
This minute but massive nucleus is, in a sense, a world of its own which
is little, if at all, influenced by the ordinary physical and chemical
forces at our command. In many respects, the problem of nuclear
structure is much more difficult than the corresponding problem of the
arrangement and motions of the planetary electrons, where we have a
wealth of available information, both physical and chemical, to test the
adequacy of our theories. The facts known about the nucleus are few in
number and the methods of attack to throw light on its structure are
limited in scope.
</p>
<p>
It is convenient to distinguish between the properties assigned to the
nucleus and the planetary electrons. The movements of the outer
electrons are responsible for the X-ray and optical spectra of the
elements and their configuration for the ordinary physical and chemical
properties of the element. On the other hand, the phenomena of
radioactivity and all properties that depend on the mass of the atom are
to be definitely assigned to the nucleus. From a study of the
radioactive transformations, we know that the nucleus of a heavy atom
not only contains positively charged bodies but also negative electrons,
so that the nuclear charge is the excess of positive charge over
negative. In recent years, the general idea has arisen that there are
two definite fundamental units that have to do with the building up of
complex nuclei, viz., the light negative electron and the relatively
massive hydrogen nucleus which is believed to correspond to the positive
electron.
</p>
<p>
This view has received very strong support from the experiments of Aston
on Isotopes in which he has shown that the masses of the various species
of atoms are represented nearly by whole numbers in terms of O = 16.
From the general electric theory, it is to be anticipated that the mass
of the hydrogen nucleus in the nucleus structure will be somewhat less
than its value 1.0077 in the free state on account of the very close
packing of the charged units in the concentrated nucleus. From Aston's
experiments, it appears that the average mass of the hydrogen nucleus,
or proton as it is now generally called, is very nearly 1.000 under
these conditions. We should anticipate that the whole number rule found
by Aston would hold only to a first approximation, since the mass of the
proton must be to some extent dependent on the detailed structure of the
nucleus. In the case of tin and xenon Aston has already signalized a
definite departure from the whole number rule, and no doubt a still more
accurate determination of the masses of the atoms will disclose other
differences of a similar kind.
</p>
<p>
While our present evidence indicates that the proton and electron are
the fundamental constituents of the nucleus, it is very probable that
secondary combining units play a prominent part in nuclear constitution.
For example, the expulsion of helium nuclei from the radioactive bodies
indicates that the helium nucleus of mass 4 is probably a secondary unit
of great importance in atom building. On the views outlined, we should
expect the helium nucleus of charge to be built up of four protons and
two electrons. The loss of mass in forming this nucleus indicates that a
large amount of energy must be liberated during its formation. If this
be the case, the helium nucleus must be such a stable structure that the
combined energy of four or five of the swiftest <i>α</i> particles would be
necessary to effect its disruption. Such a deduction is supported by our
failure to observe any evidence of disintegration of the swift particle
itself, whether it is used to bombard matter or whether the <i>α</i>
particle is used to bombard other helium atoms.
</p>
<p>
On these views, we should anticipate that the nucleus of radium of
atomic number 88 and atomic weight 22.6 contains in all 226 protons of
mass 1 and 138 electrons. While this gives us the numerical relation
between the two fundamental units, we have, at present, no definite
information of their arrangement in the minute nuclear volume, nor of
the nature and magnitude of the forces that hold them together. We
should anticipate that many of the protons and electrons unite to form
secondary units, <i>e. g.</i> helium nuclei, and that the detailed
structure of the nucleus may be very different from that to be expected
if it consists of a conglomeration of free protons and electrons.
</p>
<p>
It is thus of great importance to obtain definite evidence of the nature
and arrangement of the components of the nucleus and of the forces that
hold them in equilibrium. We shall now consider some of the lines of
evidence which throw light on the actual dimensions of the nucleus and
the law of force operative in its neighborhood; the structure and modes
of vibration of the nucleus, together with the effects observed when
some light nuclei are disintegrated by bombardment with <i>α</i> particles.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h4>DIMENSIONS OF THE NUCLEI AND THE
LAW OF FORCE</h4>

<p>
The conception of the nucleus atom had its origin in 1911 in order to
explain the scattering of an <i>α</i> particle through a large angle as the
result of a single collision. The observation that the <i>α</i> particle is
in some cases deflected through more than a right angle as the result of an
encounter with a single atom first brought to light the intense forces
that exist close to the nucleus. Geiger and Marsden showed that the
number of particles scattered through different angles was in close
accord with the simple theory which supposed that, for the distance
involved, the <i>α</i> particle and nucleus behaved like charged points,
repelling each other according to the law of the inverse square. The
accuracy of this law has been independently verified by Chadwick, so
that we are now certain that in a region close to the nucleus the
ordinary laws of force are valid.
</p>
<p>
These scattering experiments also gave us the first idea as to the
probable dimensions of the nuclei of heavy atoms, for it is to be
anticipated that the law of the inverse square must break down if the
<i>α</i> particle approaches closely to or actually enters the nuclear
structure. This variation in the law of force would show itself by a
difference between the observed and calculated numbers of <i>α</i>
particles scattered through large angles. Geiger and Marsden, however,
observed no certain variation even when the <i>α</i> particles of range
about 4 cms. were scattered through 100° by a gold nucleus. In such an
encounter, the closest distance of approach of the <i>α</i> particle to
the center of the nucleus is about 5 x 10<sup>-12</sup> cm., so that it
would appear that the radius of the gold nucleus, assumed spherical,
could not be much greater than this value.
</p>
<p>
There is another argument, based on radioactive data, which gives a
similar value for the dimensions of the radius of a heavy atom. The
<i>α</i> particle escaping from the nucleus increases in energy as it
passes through the repulsive field of the nucleus. To fix a minimum
limit, suppose the <i>α</i> particle from uranium, which is the slowest
of all <i>α</i> particles expelled from a nucleus, gains all its energy
from the electrostatic field. It can be calculated on these data that
the radius of the uranium nucleus cannot be less than 6 x
10<sup>-12</sup> cm. This is based on the assumption that the forces
outside the nucleus are repulsive and purely electrostatic. If, as seems
not unlikely, there also exist close to the nucleus strong attractive
forces, varying more rapidly than an inverse square law, the actual
dimensions may be less than the value calculated above.
</p>
<p>
At this stage of our knowledge it is of great importance to test whether
the law of force breaks down for the distance of closest approach of an
<i>α</i> particle to a nucleus. This can be done by comparing the
observed with the calculated number of <i>α</i> particles scattered
through angles of nearly 180°. It seems almost certain that the inverse
square law must break down when swift <i>α</i> particles are used. This
can be seen from the following argument. If an <i>α</i> particle, of
the same speed as that ejected during the transformation of uranium, is
fired directly at the uranium nucleus, <i>it must penetrate into the
nuclear structure</i>. If a still swifter <i>α</i> particle is used,
<i>e. g.</i> that from radium C, which has about twice the energy of the
uranium <i>α</i> particle, it is clear that it must penetrate still
more deeply into the nuclear structure. This is based on the assumption
that the field due to a nucleus is approximately symmetrical in all
directions. If this is not true, it may happen that only a fraction of
the head-on collisions may be effective in penetrating the nucleus. It
is hoped soon to attack this difficult problem experimentally.
</p>
<p>
We have so far dealt with collisions of an <i>α</i> particle with a
heavy atom. We know, however, from the results of Rutherford, Chadwick
and Bieler that in a collision of an <i>α</i> particle with the
lightest atom, hydrogen, the law of the inverse square breaks down
entirely when swift particles are used. Not only are the numbers of H
nuclei set in swift motion much greater than is to be expected in the
simple-point nucleus theory, but the change of number with the velocity
of the <i>α</i> particle varies in the opposite way from the simple
theory. Such wide departures between theory and experiment are only
explicable if we assume either that the nuclei have sensible dimensions
or that the inverse square law of repulsion entirely breaks down in such
close collisions. If we suppose the complexity in structure and in laws
of force is to be ascribed to the <i>α</i> particle rather than to the
hydrogen nucleus, Chadwick and Bieler, as the result of a careful series
of experiments, concluded that the <i>α</i> particle behaved as if it
were a perfectly elastic body, spheroidal in shape with its minor axis 4
x 10<sup>-13</sup> cm. in the direction of motion and major axis 8 x
10<sup>-13</sup> cm. Outside this spheroidal region the forces fell off
according to the ordinary inverse square law, but inside this region the
forces increased so rapidly that a particle was reflected from it as
from a perfectly elastic body. No doubt such a conception is somewhat
artificial, but it does serve to bring out the essential points involved
in the collision, viz., that when the nuclei approach within a certain
critical distance of each other, forces come into play which vary more
rapidly than the inverse square. It is difficult to ascribe this
break-down of the law of force merely to the finite size or complexity
of the nuclear structure or to its distortion, but the results rather
point to the presence of new and unexpected forces which come into play
at such small distances. This view has been confirmed by some recent
experiments of Bieler in the Cavendish Laboratory in which he has made,
by scattering methods, a detailed examination of the law of force in the
neighborhood of a light nucleus like that of aluminum. For this purpose
he compared the relative number of <i>α</i> particles scattered within
the same angular limit from aluminum and from gold. For the range of
angles employed, viz., up to 100°, it is assumed that the scattering of
gold follows the inverse square law. He found that the ratio of the
scattering in aluminum compared with that in gold depended on the
velocity of the <i>α</i> particle. For example, for an <i>α</i>
particle of 3.4 cms. range, the theoretical ratio was obtained for
angles of deflection below 40° but was about 7 per cent lower for an
average angle of deflection of 80°. On the other hand, for swifter
particles of range 6.6 cms. a departure from the theoretical ratio was
much more marked and amounted to 29 per cent for an angle of 80°. In
order to account for these results he supposes that close to the
aluminum nucleus an attractive force is superimposed on the ordinary
repulsive forces. The results agreed best with the assumption that the
attractive force varies according to the inverse fourth power of the
distance and that the forces of attraction and repulsion balanced at
about 3.4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> cm. from the nuclear center. Inside this
critical radius the forces are entirely attractive; outside they are
repulsive.
</p>
<p>
While we need not lay too much stress on the accuracy of the actual
value obtained or of the law of attractive force, we shall probably not
be far in error in supposing the radius of the aluminum nucleus is not
greater than 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> cm. It is of interest to note that the
forces between an <i>α</i> particle and a hydrogen nucleus were found
to vary rapidly at about the same distance.
</p>
<p>
It thus seems clear that the dimensions of the nuclei of light atoms are
small, and almost unexpectedly small in the case of aluminum when we
remember that 27 protons and 14 electrons are concentrated in such a
minute region. The view that the forces between nuclei change from
repulsion to attraction when they are very close together seems very
probable, for otherwise it is exceedingly difficult to understand why a
heavy nucleus with a large excess of positive charge can hold together
in such a confined region. We shall see that the evidence from various
other directions supports such a conception, but it is very unlikely
that the attractive forces close to a complex nucleus can be expressed
by any simple power law.
</p>

<h4>RADIOACTIVE EVIDENCE</h4>

<p>
A study of the long series of transformations which occur in uranium and
thorium provides us with a wealth of information on the modes of
disintegration of atoms, but unfortunately our theories of nuclear
structure are not sufficiently advanced to interpret these data with any
detail. The expulsion of high speed <i>α</i> and <i>β</i> particles
from the radioactive nucleus gives us some idea of the powerful forces
resident in the nucleus, for it can be estimated that the energy of
emission of the <i>α</i> particle is in some cases greater than the
energy that would be acquired if the <i>α</i> particle fell freely
between two points differing in potential by about 4 million volts. The
energies of the <i>β</i> and <i>γ</i> rays are on a similar scale of
magnitude.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding our detailed knowledge of the successive transformation
of the radio-elements, we have not so far been able to obtain any
definite idea of their nuclear structure, while the cause of the
disintegration is still a complete enigma. In comparing the uranium,
thorium, and actinium series of transformations, one cannot fail to be
struck by the many points of similarity in their modes of
disintegration. Not only are the radiations similar in type and in
energy, but, in all cases, the end product is believed to be an isotope
of lead. This remarkable similarity in the modes of transformation is
especially exemplified in the case of the "C" bodies, each of which is
known to break up in at least two distinct ways, giving rise to branch
products. For example, thorium C emits two types of <i>α</i> rays, 65
percent of range 8.6 cms. and 35 per cent of range 4.8 cms., and in
addition some <i>β</i> rays.
</p>
<p>
In order to explain these results, it has been suggested that a fraction
of the atoms of thorium C break up first with the expulsion of an
<i>α</i> particle and the resulting product then emits a <i>β</i>
particle. The other fraction breaks up in a reverse way, first expelling
a <i>β</i> particle, while the subsequent product emits an <i>α</i>
particle. Similar dual changes occur in radium C and actinium C,
although the relative number of atoms in each branch varies widely for
the different elements.
</p>
<p>
This remarkable similarity between the "C" bodies is still further
emphasized by the recent discovery of Bates and Rogers that both radium
C and thorium C give rise in small numbers to other groups of <i>α</i>
particles, some of them moving at very high speeds.
</p>
<p>
It has often been a matter of remark that the radioactive properties of
the "C" bodies seem to depend more on the atomic number, <i>i. e.</i>,
the nuclear charge, than on the atomic weight. Confining our attention
to radium C and thorium C, which are best known, both have a nuclear
charge 83, but the atomic mass of radium C is 214 and of thorium C 212.
The nucleus of radium C thus contains two protons and two electrons more
than that of thorium C. If it were supposed that the nuclei of these
elements consisted of a large number of charged units in ceaseless and
irregular motion, it is to be anticipated that the addition of the
protons and electrons to the complex structure would entirely alter the
nuclear arrangement and consequently its stability and mode of
transformation. On the other hand, we find that the modes of
transformation of these two nuclei have striking and unexpected points
of resemblance which are in entire disaccord with such a supposition. We
can, however, suggest a possible explanation of this anomaly by
supposing that the <i>α</i> and <i>β</i> particles which are liberated
from these elements are not built deep into the nuclear structure but
exist as <i>satellites</i> of a central core which is common to both
elements. These satellites, if in motion, may be held in equilibrium by
the attractive forces arising from the core, and these forces would be
the same for both elements. On this view the manifestations of
radioactivity are to be ascribed not to the main core, but to the
satellite distribution, which must be somewhat different for the two
elements although possibly showing many points of similarity. It must be
admitted that a theory of this kind is highly speculative, but it does
provide a useful working hypothesis, not only to account for the
similarity of the modes of transformation of the two elements but also
immediately suggests a possible explanation of the liberation of a
number of <i>α</i> particles of different ranges from the same element.
There are two ways of regarding this question. We may in the first place
suppose that a certain amount of surplus energy has to be liberated in
the disintegration and that this energy may be given to any one of a
number of satellites. There will be a certain probability that any
particular particle will be given this energy, and on this will depend
the relative number of particles in the different <i>α</i> ray groups.
The ultimate energy of ejection of an <i>α</i> particle will depend on
its position in the field of force surrounding the inner core at the
moment of its liberation. On the other hand, we may suppose that the
same <i>α</i> particle is always ejected but that the particle may
occupy in the atom one of a number of "stationary" positions analogous
to the "stationary states" of the electrons in Bohr's theory of the
outer atom. This rests on the assumption that all the atoms will not be
identical in satellite structure but there will be a number of possible
"excited" states of the atom as a consequence of the previous
disintegrations. This satellite theory is useful in another connection.
It has been suggested that possibly the high frequency <i>γ</i> rays
from a radioactive atom may arise not from the movement of the electrons
as ordinarily supposed, but from the transfer of <i>α</i> particles
from one level to another. In such a case, the difference in energies
between the various groups of <i>α</i> particles from radium C and
thorium C should be connected by the quantum relation with the
frequencies of prominent <i>γ</i> rays. The evidence at present
available is not definite enough to give a final decision on this
problem, but points to the need of very accurate measurements of the
energies of the various groups of <i>α</i> particles. On account of the
relatively small number of particles in some of the groups, this is
difficult of accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
In considering the satellite theory in connection with the radioactive
bodies, it is at first sight natural to suppose, since the end product
of both the radium and thorium series is an isotope of lead, that one of
the isotopes of lead forms the central core. It may, however, well be
that the radioactive processes cease when there are still a number of
satellites remaining. If this be so, the core may be of smaller nuclear
charge and mass than that of lead. From some considerations, described
later, this core may correspond to an element near platinum of number 77
and mass 192.
</p>

<h4>FREQUENCY OF VIBRATION OF THE NUCLEUS</h4>

<p>
One of the most interesting and important methods of throwing light on
nuclear structure is the study of the very penetrating <i>γ</i> rays
expelled by some radioactive bodies. The <i>γ</i> rays are identical in
nature with X-rays, but the most penetrating type of rays consists of
waves of much higher frequency than can be produced in an ordinary X-ray
tube. The work of the last few years has indicated very clearly that the
major part of the <i>γ</i> radiation from bodies like radium B and C
originates in the nucleus. A determination of the frequencies of the
<i>γ</i> rays thus gives us direct information on the modes of
vibration of parts of the nuclear structure. The frequency of some of
the softer <i>γ</i> rays excited by radium B and radium C was measured
by the crystal method by Rutherford and Andrade, but it is difficult, if
not impossible, by this method to determine the frequencies of the very
penetrating rays. Fortunately, due largely to the work of Ellis and
Fräulein Meitner, a new and powerful method has been devised for this
purpose. It is well known that the <i>β</i> rays from radium B and
radium C give a veritable spectrum in a magnetic field, showing the
presence of a number of groups of <i>β</i> rays each expelled with a
definite speed. It is clear that each of the groups of <i>β</i> rays
arises from conversion of the energy of a <i>γ</i> ray of definite
frequency into a <i>β</i> ray in one or other of the electronic levels
in the outer atom. The energy ω required to move an electron from one
of these levels to the outside of the atom is known from a study of
X-ray absorption spectra. The frequency ν of the <i>γ</i> ray is thus
given by the quantum relation hν = E + ω, where E is the measured
energy of the <i>β</i> particle.
</p>
<p>
Since each <i>γ</i> ray may be converted in any one of the known
electronic levels in the outer atom, a single <i>γ</i> ray is
responsible for the appearance of a number of groups of <i>β</i> rays,
corresponding to conversion in the K, L, M, etc., levels. In this way,
an analysis of the <i>β</i> ray spectrum allows us to fix the frequency
of the more intense <i>γ</i> rays which are emitted from the nucleus.
The energy of the shortest wave measured in this way by Ellis
corresponds to more than two million volts, while other evidence shows
that probably still shorter waves are emitted in small quantity from
radium C.
</p>
<p>
Ellis and Skinner have shown that the energies of these rays show
certain combination differences, such as are so characteristic of the
energies of the X-rays arising from the outer electrons. A series of
energy levels may thus be postulated in the nucleus similar in character
to the electron levels of the outer atom, and the <i>γ</i> rays have their
origin in the fall either of an electron or of an <i>α</i> particle between
these levels. This is a significant and important result, indicating
that the quantum dynamics can be applied to the nucleus as well as to
the outer electronic structure.
</p>
<p>
The probability of levels in the nuclear structure is most clearly seen
on the satellite hypothesis, but in our ignorance of the laws of force
near the core we are at the moment unable to apply the quantum dynamics
directly to the problem. The outlook for further advances in this
direction is hopeful, but is intimately connected with a further
development of our knowledge of the laws of force that come into play
close to the nucleus in the region occupied by the satellites.
</p>

<h4>ARTIFICIAL DISINTEGRATION OF ELEMENTS</h4>

<p>
We have seen that it is believed that the nuclei of all atoms are
composed of protons and electrons and that the number of each of these
units in any nucleus can be deduced from its mass and nuclear charge. It
is, however, at first sight rather surprising that no evidence of the
individual existence of protons in a nucleus is obtained from a study of
the transformations of the radioactive elements, where the processes
occurring must be supposed to be of a very fundamental character. As far
as our observations have gone, electrons and helium nuclei, but no
protons, are ejected during the long series of transformations of
uranium, thorium and actinium. One of the most obvious methods for
determining the structure of a nucleus is to find a method of
disintegrating it into its component parts. This is done spontaneously
for us by nature to a limited extent in the case of the heavy
radioactive elements, but evidence of this character is not available in
the case of the ordinary elements.
</p>
<p>
As the swift <i>α</i> particle from the radioactive bodies is, by far,
the most energetic projectile known to us, it seemed from the first
possible that occasionally the nucleus of a light atom might be
disintegrated as the result of a close collision with an <i>α</i>
particle. On account of the minute size of the nucleus, it is to be
anticipated that the chance of a direct hit would be very small and that
consequently the disintegration effects, if any, would be observed only
on a very minute scale. During the last few years Dr. Chadwick and I
have obtained definite evidence that hydrogen nuclei or protons can be
removed by bombardment of <i>α</i> particles from the elements boron,
nitrogen, fluorine, sodium, aluminum and phosphorus. In these
experiments the presence of H nuclei is detected by the scintillation
method, and their maximum velocity of ejection can be estimated from the
thickness of matter which can be penetrated by these particles. The
number of H nuclei ejected even in the most favorable case is relatively
very small compared with the number of bombarding <i>α</i> particles,
viz., about one in a million.
</p>
<p>
In these experiments the material subject to bombardment was placed
immediately in front of the source of <i>α</i> particles and
observations on the ejected particles were made on a zinc sulphide
screen placed in a direct line a few centimetres away. Using radium C as
a source of <i>α</i> rays, the ranges of penetration, expressed in
terms of centimetres of air, were all in these cases greater than the
range of free nuclei (30 cms. in air) set in motion in hydrogen by the
<i>α</i> particles. By inserting absorbing screens of 30 cms. air
equivalent in front of the zinc sulphide screen the results were quite
independent of the presence of either free or combined hydrogen as an
impurity in the bombarded materials. Some of the lighter elements were
examined for absorptions less than this, but, in general, the number of
H particles due to hydrogen contamination of the source and the
materials was so large that no confidence could be placed in the
results.
</p>
<p>
In such experiments many scintillations can be observed, but it is very
difficult to decide whether these can be ascribed in part to an actual
disintegration of the material under examination. The presence of
long-range particles of the <i>α</i> ray type from the source of radium C
still further complicates the question, since in general the number of
such particles is large compared with the disintegration effect we
usually observe.
</p>
<p>
To overcome these difficulties, inherent in the direct method of
observation, Dr. Chadwick and I have devised a simple method by which we
can observe with certainty the disintegration of an element when the
ejected particles have a range of only 7 cms. in air. This method is
based on the assumption, verified in our previous experiments, that the
disintegration particles are emitted in all directions relative to the
incident rays. A powerful beam of <i>α</i> rays falls on the material
to be examined and the liberated particles are observed at an average
angle of 90° to the direction of the incident <i>α</i> particles. By
means of screens it is arranged that no <i>α</i> particles can fall
directly on the zinc sulphide screen.
</p>
<p>
This method has many advantages. We can now detect particles of range
more than 7 cms. with the same certainty as particles of range above 30
cms. in our previous experiments, for the presence of hydrogen in the
bombarded material has no effect. This can be shown at once by
bombarding a screen of paraffin wax, when no particles are observed on
the zinc sulphide screen. On account of the very great reduction in
number of H nuclei or <i>α</i> particles by scattering through 90°, the
results are quite independent of H nuclei from the source or of the
long-range <i>α</i> particles. The latter are just detectable under our
experimental conditions when a heavy element like gold is used as
scattering material, but are inappreciable for the lighter elements.
</p>
<p>
A slight modification of the arrangement enables us to examine gases as
well as solids.
</p>
<p>
Working in this way we have found that in addition to the elements
boron, nitrogen, fluorine, sodium, aluminum, and phosphorus, which give
H particles of maximum range in the forward direction between 40 and 90
cms., the following give particles of range above 7 cms.: neon,
magnesium, silicon, sulphur, chlorine, argon, and potassium. The numbers
of the particles emitted from these elements are small compared with the
number from aluminum under the same conditions, varying between ⅓ and
¹⁄₂₀. The ranges of the particles have not been determined with
accuracy. Neon appears to give the shortest range, about 16 cms., under
our conditions, the ranges of the others lying between 18 cms. and 30
cms. By the kindness of Dr. Rosenhain we were able to make experiments
with a sheet of metallic beryllium. This gave a small effect, about
¹⁄₃₀ of that of aluminum, but we are not yet certain that it may
not be due to the presence of a small quantity of fluorine as an
impurity. The other light elements, hydrogen, helium, lithium, carbon,
and oxygen, give no detectable effect beyond 7 cms. It is of interest to
note that while carbon and oxygen give no effect, sulphur, also probably
a "pure" element of mass 4n, gives an effect of nearly one-third that of
aluminum. This shows clearly that the sulphur nucleus is not built up
solely of helium nuclei, a conclusion also suggested by its atomic
weight of 32.07.
</p>
<p>
We have made a preliminary examination of the elements from calcium to
iron, but with no definite results, owing to the difficulty of obtaining
these elements free from any of the "active" elements, in particular,
nitrogen. For example, while a piece of electrolytic iron gave no
particles beyond 7 cms., a piece of Swedish iron gave a large effect,
which was undoubtedly due to the presence of nitrogen, for after
prolonged heating <i>in vacuo</i> the greater part disappeared. Similar
results were experienced with the other elements in this region.
</p>
<p>
We have observed no effects from the following elements: nickel, copper,
zinc, selenium, krypton, molybdenum, palladium, silver, tin, xenon, gold
and uranium. The krypton and xenon were kindly lent by Dr. Aston.
</p>

<h4>EXAMINATION OF LIGHT ELEMENTS FOR PARTICLES
OF RANGE LESS THAN 3 CMS. OF AIR</h4>

<p>
When <i>α</i> particles are scattered from light elements, the simple
theory shows that the velocity of the scattered particles depends on the
angle of scattering. For example, using bombarding <i>α</i> particles
of range 7 cms., the range of the <i>α</i> particles scattered through
more than 90° cannot be greater than 1.0 cm. for lithium (7), 2.0 cms.
for beryllium (10), 2.5 cms. for carbon, 3.2 cms. for oxygen, 4.3 cms.
for aluminum, and 6.8 cms. for gold.
</p>
<p>
Provided we introduce sufficient thickness of absorber to stop the <i>α</i>
particles scattered through 90°, we can examine for disintegrated
particles from carbon, for example, whose range exceeds 2.5 cms. Certain
difficulties arise in this type of experiment which are absent when the
thickness of absorber is greater than 7 cms.; any heavy element present
as an impurity will give scattered <i>α</i> particles of range greater than
those from carbon and thus complicate the observations. In addition,
serious troubles may arise due to the volatilization or escape of active
matter from the source. This is especially marked if the vessel
containing the radioactive source is exhausted. To overcome this
difficulty, we have found it desirable to cover the source with a thin
layer of celluloid of 2 or 3 mm. stopping power for <i>α</i> rays. By this
procedure we have been able to avoid serious contamination and to
examine the lighter elements by this method. We have been unable to
detect any appreciable number of particles from lithium or carbon for
ranges greater than 3 cms. If carbon shows any effect at all, it is
certainly less than one tenth of the number from aluminum under the same
conditions. This is in entire disagreement with the work of Kirsch and
Patterson (Nature, April 26, 1924), who found evidence of a large number
of particles from carbon of range 6 cms. A slight effect was observed in
beryllium in accordance with our other experiments. No effect was noted
in oxygen gas. Apart from beryllium, no certain effect has been noted
for elements lighter than boron.
</p>
<p>
Under the conditions of our experiment, it seems clear that neither H
nuclei nor other particles of range greater than 3 cms. can be liberated
in appreciable numbers from these elements in a direction at right
angles to the bombarding <i>α</i> rays. This is, in a sense, a
disappointing result, for, unless these elements are very firmly bound
structures, it was to be anticipated that an <i>α</i> particle
bombardment would resolve them into their constituent particles.
</p>
<p>
We hope to examine this whole question still more thoroughly, as it is a
matter of great importance to the theory of nuclear constitution to be
certain whether or not the light elements can be disintegrated by swift
<i>α</i> particles.
</p>
<p>
In considering the results of our new and old observations, some points
of striking interest emerge. In the first place, all the elements from
fluorine to potassium inclusive suffer disintegration under <i>α</i> ray
bombardment. As far as our observations have gone, there seems little
doubt that the particles ejected from all these elements are H nuclei.
The odd elements, B, N, F, Na, Al, P, all give long-range particles
varying in range from 40 cms. to 90 cms. in the forward direction, the
even elements, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, either give few particles or none at
all as in the case of C and O, or give particles of much less range than
the adjacent odd numbered elements. The differences between the ranges
of even-odd elements become much less marked for elements heavier than
phosphorus.
</p>
<p>
This obvious difference in velocity of expulsion of the H nuclei from
even and odd elements is a matter of great interest. Such a distinction
can be paralleled by other observations of an entirely different
character. Harkins has shown that elements of even atomic number are
much more abundant in the earth's crust than elements of odd atomic
number. In his study of Isotopes, Aston has shown that in general odd
numbered elements have only two isotopes differing in mass by two units,
while even numbered elements in some cases contain a large number of
isotopes. This remarkable distinction between even and odd elements
cannot but excite a lively curiosity, but we can at present only
speculate on its underlying cause.
</p>

<h4>VELOCITY OF ESCAPE OF HYDROGEN NUCLEI</h4>

<p>
We have seen that the experiments of Bieler on the scattering of <i>α</i>
rays by aluminum and magnesium indicate that a powerful attractive force
comes into play very close to the nuclei of these atoms. If this be the
case, the forces of attraction and repulsion must balance at a certain
distance from the nucleus. Outside this critical point the forces on a
positively charged body are entirely repulsive. Certain important
consequences follow from this general view of nuclear forces. Suppose,
for example, that, due to a collision with a swift <i>α</i> particle, a
hydrogen nucleus is liberated from the nuclear structure. After passing
across the critical surface, it will acquire energy in passing through
the repulsive field. It is clear, on this view, that the energy of a
charged particle after escape from the atom cannot be less than the
energy acquired in the repulsive field; consequently we should expect to
find evidence that there is a minimum velocity of escape of a
disintegration particle. We have obtained definite evidence of such an
effect both in aluminum and sulphur by examining the absorption of H
nuclei from these elements. The number of scintillations for a thin film
was found to be nearly constant for absorption between 7 and 12 cms.,
but falls off rapidly for greater thicknesses. This is exactly what is
to be expected on the views outlined. No doubt the limiting velocity
varies somewhat for the different elements, but a large amount of
experiment will be required to fix this limit with accuracy. From these
results it is possible to form a rough estimate of the potential of the
field at the critical surface, and this comes out to be about 3 million
volts for aluminum. The value for sulphur is somewhat greater. This
brings out in a striking way the extraordinary smallness of the nuclei
of these elements, for it can be calculated that the critical surface
cannot be distant more than 6 x 10<sup>-13</sup> cm. from the centre of the
nucleus. These deductions of the critical distance are in excellent
accord with those made by Bieler from observations of the scattering of
<i>α</i> particles.
</p>
<p>
Another important consequence follows. It is clear that an <i>α</i>
particle fired at the nucleus will not be able to cross this critical
surface and thus be in a position to produce disintegration, unless its
velocity exceeds that corresponding to the critical potential. In an
experiment made a few years ago, we found that the number of H nuclei
liberated from aluminum fell off rapidly with diminution of the velocity
of the <i>α</i> particle and was too small in number to detect when the
range of the <i>α</i> particle was less than 4.9 cms. This corresponds
to the energy of an <i>α</i> particle falling between about 3 million
volts&mdash;a value in good accord with that calculated from the escape
of H nuclei.
</p>
<p>
Further experiments are required with other elements to test if this
relation between the minimum velocity of H nuclei and the minimum
velocity of the <i>α</i> particle to produce disintegration holds
generally; but the results as far as they go are certainly very
suggestive.
</p>
<p>
It is of interest to note that these results afford a definite proof of
the nuclear conception of the atom and give us some hope that we may
determine the magnitude of the critical potential for a number of the
light elements.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h4>EVOLUTION OF NUCLEI</h4>

<p>
In concluding, I would like to make a few remarks of a more speculative
character dealing with the fundamental problem of the origin and
evolution of the elements from the two fundamental building units, the
positive and negative electrons. It must be confessed that there is
little information to guide us with the exception of our knowledge of
the nuclear charges and masses of the various species of elements which
survive to-day. It has always been a matter of great difficulty to
imagine how the more complex nuclei can be built up by the successive
additions of protons and electrons, since the proton must be endowed
with a very high speed to approach closely to the charged nucleus. I
have already discussed in this paper the evidence that powerful
attractive forces varying very rapidly with the distance are present
close to the nuclear structure and it seems probable that these forces
must ultimately be ascribed to the constituent proton. In such a case it
may be possible for an electron and proton to form a very close
combination, or neutron, as I have termed it. The probable distance
between the centre of this doublet is of the order of 3 x
10<sup>-13</sup> cm. The forces between two neutrons would be very small
except for distance of approach of this order of magnitude, and it is
probable that the neutrons would collect together in much the same
fashion as a number of small movable magnets would tend to form a
coherent group held together by their mutual forces.
</p>
<p>
In considering the origin of the elements, we may for simplicity suppose
a large diffused mass of hydrogen which is gradually heated by its
gravitational condensation. At high temperatures the gas would consist
mainly of free hydrogen nuclei and electrons, and some of these would in
course of time combine to form neutrons, emitting energy in the process.
These neutrons would collect together in nuclear masses of all kinds of
complexity. Now the tendency of the groups of neutrons would be to form
more stable nuclear combinations, such as helium nuclei of mass four,
and possibly intermediate stages of masses two and three. Energy would
be emitted in these processes probably in the form of swift surplus
electrons which were not necessary for the stability of the system. In a
sense, all these nuclear masses would be radioactive, but some of them
in their transformation may reach a stable configuration which would
represent the nucleus of one of our surviving elements. If we suppose
that nuclear masses over a wide range of mass can be formed before
serious transformation occurs, it is easy to see how every possible type
of stable element will gradually emerge. If we take the helium nucleus
as a combining unit which emits in its formation the greatest amount of
energy, we should ultimately expect many of the neutrons in a heavy
nucleus to form helium nuclei. These helium nuclei would tend to collect
together and form definite systems and it seems not unlikely that they
will group themselves into orderly structures, analogous in some
respects to the regular arrangement of atoms to form crystals, but with
much smaller distances between the structural units. In such a case,
some of the elements may consist of a central crystal type of structure
of helium nuclei surrounded by positive and negatively charged
satellites in motion round this central core. Assuming that such orderly
arrangements of helium nuclei are possible, it is of interest to note
that the observed relations between atomic charge and atomic mass for
the elements can be approximately obtained on a very simple assumption.
Suppose that helium nuclei form a point centred cubic lattice with an
electron at the centre of a crystal unit of eight helium nuclei. A few
of the possible types of grouping are given in the following table, with
corresponding masses and nuclear charges. The structure 4. 3. 2. means
a rectangular arrangement with sides containing 4. 3. 2. nuclei
respectively. It will thus contain 24 helium nuclei, have a mass 96, and
will contain 6 intranuclear electrons. Its nuclear charge will therefore
be 48 - 6 = 41.

<p>
While the agreement is far from perfect for all these structures, there
is a general accord with observation. If we take the view that some of
these structures can grow by the addition of satellites, there is room
for adjustment of masses and to include the intervening elements. This
point of view is admittedly very speculative and there may well be other
types of structure involved. At the same time, the general evidence
suggests that there are some basal structures on which the heavier atoms
are progressively built up. The failure of the whole number rule for the
mass of isotopes, observed in some cases by Aston, <i>e.g.</i>, between tin
and xenon, certainly supports such a conception. From a study of the
artificial disintegration of the elements we have seen that carbon and
oxygen represent very stable structures probably composed of helium
nuclei. It is possible that oxygen nuclei, for example, may be the
structural basis of some of the elements following oxygen, but our
information is at present too meagre to be at all certain on this point.
</p>
<p>
I think, however, it will be clear from this lecture what a difficult
but fascinating problem is involved in the structure of nuclei. Before
we can hope to make much advance, it is essential to know more of the
nature of the forces operative close to protons and electrons, and we
may hope to acquire much information by a detailed study of the
scattering of swift <i>α</i> rays and <i>β</i> rays by nuclei. Fortunately,
there is now a number of distinct lines of attack on this problem, and
from a combination of the results obtained we may hope to make steady, if
not rapid, progress in the solution of this, the greatest problem in
Physics.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
